Project 2 
This project is basically a basic midi reader. It uses 2 col (collections) and a metro to look at the note timing to play these two col at the same time. It recquires no extra file downloads or anything. It is quite simple in function but does the job. 
Basically you can input a list of midi notes in this format (index, note, velocity, timing (in miliseconds)) 
Because of the metro, it reads the first col and follows along with its timing with both col files. 

The song hardcoded in is hotcross buns.
